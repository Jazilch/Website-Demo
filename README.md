# Website-Demo

While I've created many websites you will need to keep building more and more. It's amazing as you come back to your website 2 or 3 months later and feel the need to delete all of your CSS and start over again. As you keep learning more you will need to keep building either more complicated websites or trying to build out a website in the simpliest code possible. 

This is my latest website that I've built using nothing more than Sublime Text Editor. Everything in this site was custom coded and uses no jQuery plugins or bootstrap for layout. Layout was coded entirely from HTML then CSS and Vanilla Javascript were added in. Once again now using jQuery even to add animations to my website.
